# 🃏 Blackjack Game (JavaScript Practice Project)

This is a simple Blackjack game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as part of my learning journey in JavaScript.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The player is dealt two random cards.
- The goal is to get the total sum of cards as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- The player can choose to draw a new card.
- If the total equals 21, the player gets Blackjack.
- If the total exceeds 21, the player loses the game.
